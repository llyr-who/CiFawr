# CiFawr

MassStiff was the result of a 2 week university project. CiFawr is the next iteration of MassStiff. It "pulls" three projects from this GitHub, namely georhiau (meshing), solvant (matrix solver) and cipolwg (graphics) and implements them as a FEM solver. 

The idea is to reproduce the functionality of MassStiff (solve a PDE using FEM) but in an elegant and efficient way. Stay tuned.
